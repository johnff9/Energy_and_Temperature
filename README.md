# Global Temperature Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes global temperature changes over the years using data visualization techniques in Python. The dataset contains historical temperature variations categorized by month and year, providing insights into climate trends. As well as the energy consumption from each country and how renewable energy is being produced as well as how much is being produced.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Prepares the dataset for visualization by reshaping it from wide to long format.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarizes data trends and distributions.
- **Visualization with Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Creates insightful graphs to depict temperature changes over time.
- **Aggregation & Grouping**: Allows analysis of temperature changes by month and year.

## File Structure
- `data/` - Raw dataset folder
- `Data_analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for analysis
- `README.md` - Project documentation
